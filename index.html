                The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic
                dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The
                dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.
                Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
                diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[4]</p>
